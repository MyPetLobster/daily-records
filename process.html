    <h1>Daily Records Process</h1>
    <h2>CS50 SQL Final Project</h2>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a project that I will actually use regularly</li>
        <li>Use a new DBMS other than Sqlite to try something new</li>
        <li>Create a database to keep track of my "daily records" to replace my Notes app folder</li>
        <li>Keep track of work hours, school hours, jobs, clients, things I'm learning, etc.</li>
        <li>Create a simple interface that will be easy for me to use</li>
        <li>Ability to check totals and summaries</li>
        <li>Ability to export data to CSV</li>
        <li>Ability to generate invoices automatically (or info for invoices)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Process</h3>
    <p class="process-description">
        I will be keeping track of my process as I create the project and constantly updating the information below. I started 
        making these process.html files with BookcaseDatabase.com, and I've found it incredibly useful for reinforcing concepts 
        I'm learning and giving me a reference for future projects. I'm hoping to do the same with this project.

            <h3>Initial Brainstorming, Choosing a Database Management System</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to create a project that I would actually use on a daily basis. I have a folder in my Notes app on my
                phone where I keep track of my work hours, school hours, and other things I'm learning. My current process is 
                every few days I open Google Maps and look at my timeline to see where I was and what I was doing. Then I open 
                my Notes app and create a new note with the date and time and write down what I was doing. Then when it comes time 
                to send invoices I have to go through all of my notes one by one and add up the hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started taking programming courses on August 24, 2023. Since then, I've been keeping track of the hours I've put 
                in each day and the things I've been learning. I guess I just have a thing for keeping records. I decided to make a 
                project that would replace my Notes app folder and make it easier for me to keep track of my hours and what I'm
                learning. I also wanted to make it easy to export the data to CSV and generate invoices automatically. I'd like to 
                be able to see totals and summaries of my hours spent at specific jobs or working on specific projects.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I opted to give MySQL a try. But in the process I learned a bit about the differences between MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
                and SQLite. I realized that SQLite would probably be the best option for a simple single-user project like this. But I 
                also realized that SQLite was NOT the RDBMS to use for my last big project, Bookcase Database. Luckily, I currently have 
                three total users -- me, my aunt, and my friend. So I should be okay for now. However, I'm thinking that I will migrate 
                Bookcase Database from SQLite to MySQL or PostgreSQL in the future. So I decided to try using MySQL for this project to 
                get comfortable with it. PostgreSQL seemed like overkill for this and even Bookcase Database. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Took a minute because of issues with the PATH but I got MySQL installed and a server running. Using MySQL seems like it 
                will be very straightforward. Now that I have that installed and ready to roll, I'm going to start planning the database 
                itself.

            <h3>Database Design</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to start visually. I found a website <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/">Visual-Paradigm</a> where I could 
                create a free account and create a visual ERD. I started with the basics. I created a table for Days, Clients, Jobs, Work Hours,
                Learning Hours, Expenses and Invoices. 
            </p>
            <h5>Here is what my ERD diagram...(entity relationship diagram, diagram?) looks like as of now</h5>

            <p>
                I thought through all the relationships between tables to make sure it all made sense. I decided to add a table for Courses and 
                a table for Projects. 
            </p>
            <h5>Here is what my ERD looks like now</h5>

            <h5>....And another update to the ERD.</h5>

            <p>
                As you can see, I've created the relationships between the tables using association tables (aka junction tables, join tables, 
                etc.).
